Application Name: Intelligent Tourist System
Developer: Sherwin John Calleja Tragura
Status: Prototype stage
Date finished: August 22, 2021

=========================== Description ====================================

This application creates an interconnection between location, visits, visitors, 
and tourist spots in a particular place. The application highlights API services 
that store dynamic and fixed enum data in a Python collection about tourist 
posts in every locality in a country, state, city, or province. 
There is also a simulation of a mini-reservation mechanism given for each 
user or visitor. This prototype will be a good backbone for a travelogue-style 
microservice architecture that can be applied in tourism-related businesses. 

This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8.
