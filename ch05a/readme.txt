=========================== Description ====================================

This prototype is an application designed to manage transactions in a gym center. 
This system allows scheduling of gym customers to available gym classes like 
aerobics, boxing, circuit, pilates, etc. It also maps gym trainers to classes 
where registered gym-goers are registered. As part of the control and tracking 
mechanism, the prototype manages the attendance of the trainers and gym-goers. 

This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8.
This application now involves data storage, the relational database called 
PostgreSQL 13. 

This is PART 1 of the application that focuses on SQLAlchemy, Gino, and Pony ORM.

The ERD design (.png) and the database schema backup (.sql) 
are in the /database folder of this project.
